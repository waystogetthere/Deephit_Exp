1. generate the synthetic data set

go to: sample data/MZZ/ and launch jupyter notebook. You can generate your own synthetic data set.

2. run the main_randomSearch.py, this is where its main function is. 
The variable "data_mode" is "MZZ_200_5" which means that it would feed a synthetic data set with  200 5-D samples.
After you generate your own synthetic set, You can change the "data_mode" to your specific value.
For example, you genearte a synthetic set of 1000 10-D samples so the data_mode is MZZ_1000_10
